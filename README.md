# Feed A Mole Game

This game is similar to the game Whack-A-Mole. Instead of whacking the moles when they pop up, you feed them worms before they go back in their holes. You get one (1) point each moles you feed, and you get two (2) points each king moles you feed. When you reach to ten (10) points, you win the game! It will reward you with an image of a cute, and satisfied little mole.
